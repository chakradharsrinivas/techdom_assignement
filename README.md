## Incorporations for improving  Lighthouse score for Performance, SEO and Accessibility ##
### Used Service Worker.js 
Using a Service worker you can easily set an app up to use cached assets first, thus providing a default experience even when offline, before then getting more data from the network (commonly known as Offline First ). This is already available with native apps, which is one of the main reasons native apps are often chosen over web apps.
hence as per a reowned company survey Registering a service worker successfully gives another 18 points.
